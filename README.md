# Data-structure

This repository has been created to showcase some of the work I have done during my university degree. Specifically, this repository refers to the exercises completed during the course taken in my second year, which covered data structures in C++. These structures include linked lists, doubly linked lists, vectors, maps, unordered maps, sets, stacks, among others.
